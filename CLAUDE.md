# SPXW 0DTE TRADING SYSTEM v2.0 - COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT OVERVIEW

## 🎯 PROJECT SCOPE: Professional SPX/SPXW 0DTE Options Trading System

**MISSION:** Ultra-high-frequency SPX 0DTE options trading with institutional-grade analysis, real-time market data, and advanced risk management for consistent profitability in volatile market conditions.

## 🚫 CRITICAL: ANTI-BLOAT PROTECTION PROTOCOL

### IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY
**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Leverage Claude's analytical reasoning with real data, NOT pseudo-code frameworks.

### STRICT FORBIDDEN PATTERNS
**NEVER CREATE:**
- Fake Python classes (StreamingDataManager, GEXDEXAnalyzer, etc.)
- Pseudo-code frameworks that don't actually execute
- Multi-thousand line "implementation" sections in CLAUDE.md
- Python-style function definitions as documentation
- Complex inheritance hierarchies for analysis methods
- Mock APIs or data structures that don't exist

### CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
**WHEN USER REQUESTS**: "Add advanced GEX/DEX analysis system"
**WRONG RESPONSE**: Create 500-line GEXDEXAnalyzer class in CLAUDE.md
**CORRECT RESPONSE**: 
1. Use mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS for real options data
2. Apply GEX/DEX calculation principles using Claude reasoning
3. Add 2-3 sentence instruction to CLAUDE.md: "Calculate gamma exposure by multiplying open interest × gamma for each strike"

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISION TREE
```
User requests complex analysis feature
├── Requires heavy computation (>1000 calculations)?
│   ├── YES: Create standalone .py script
│   └── NO: Add instruction for Claude reasoning
├── Needs real-time data?
│   ├── YES: Use AlphaVantage MCP functions
│   └── NO: Use Claude's analytical capabilities
└── Result: Never add pseudo-code to CLAUDE.md
```

### BLOAT WARNING SIGNS
If you find yourself writing any of these in CLAUDE.md, STOP:
- `class AdvancedAnalyzer:`
- `def calculate_complex_metric():`
- `import numpy as np`
- Code blocks longer than 10 lines
- Variables like `self.streaming_manager`
- Method chains like `analyzer.process().calculate().validate()`

### CORRECT INSTRUCTION FORMAT
**GOOD**: "Use RSI < 30 as oversold signal with AlphaVantage RSI data"
**BAD**: "class OversoldDetector: def __init__(self): self.rsi_threshold = 30..."

### MANDATORY REVIEW QUESTIONS
Before adding ANY analysis method to CLAUDE.md, ask:
1. Can Claude do this reasoning naturally? (Usually YES)
2. Does this require real-time data? (Use MCP functions)
3. Does this need heavy computation? (Create separate .py script)
4. Am I writing executable code? (FORBIDDEN in CLAUDE.md)

### USER REQUEST HANDLING PROTOCOL
**When user says**: "I want machine learning pattern recognition"
**Response template**: 
"I'll add pattern recognition capabilities using Claude's natural analytical reasoning with AlphaVantage data. This doesn't require new Python frameworks - Claude can identify patterns by analyzing price action, volume, and technical indicators from real market data."

**Then add to CLAUDE.md**: "Pattern Recognition: Analyze price/volume relationships using RSI, EMA crossovers, and support/resistance levels from AlphaVantage data."

### ANTI-REGRESSION TESTING
If CLAUDE.md ever exceeds 1,000 lines, immediately audit for:
- Fake function definitions
- Pseudo-code classes  
- Implementation details vs instructions
- Embedded Python scripts

### MAINTAINER INSTRUCTIONS
**Monthly Review**: Check if Claude is following instructions vs creating pseudo-frameworks
**Red Flag**: Any section >100 lines likely contains implementation bloat
**Green Flag**: Instructions that reference MCP functions + Claude reasoning

## Alphavantage Real-Time Data Integration

**CRITICAL: Live real-time market data via alphavantage API - Premium Live3 access confirmed**

### Real-Time Data Access Protocol

**MCP Functions (Real-Time SPXW Options):**
```bash
# CRITICAL: ALWAYS use real-time entitlement for live trading
mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES(symbol="SPY,NVDA,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,AAPL,AMZN,META", entitlement="realtime")  # Primary real-time quotes
mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS(symbol="SPXW", require_greeks=true, entitlement="realtime")  # Real-time SPXW options
mcp__alphavantage__GLOBAL_QUOTE(symbol="SPY", entitlement="realtime")    # Individual quotes with real-time data
mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY(symbol, interval, entitlement="realtime") # Market context data
```

**DIRECT SPXW OPTIONS PROTOCOL (PRIMARY METHOD):**
```bash
# API Key: Premium Live3 with real-time entitlement (via MCP)

# Primary: Real-time SPXW Options Data  
spxw_options = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS("SPXW", require_greeks=true, entitlement="realtime")

# Primary: Real-time bulk quotes for all major symbols
bulk_quotes = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES("SPY,NVDA,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,AAPL,AMZN,META", entitlement="realtime")

# Extract SPX Price using Put-Call Parity from SPXW Options
# METHOD: Use deep ITM options (2000 strike) for accurate pricing
# Formula: SPX Price = (Call Mark - Put Mark) + Strike Price
# Example: SPX = ($4598.65 - $0.01) + $2000 = $6,598.64
# Claude extracts call mark, put mark from 2000 strike SPXW options data
current_spx_price = (call_mark_2000 - put_mark_2000) + 2000

# Technical Context with real-time data
spy_rsi = mcp__alphavantage__RSI("SPY", "5min", 14, "close", entitlement="realtime")
spy_volume = mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY("SPY", "5min", entitlement="realtime")
```

### MANDATORY Real-Time Data Rules

**CRITICAL RULES FOR LIVE SPXW TRADING:**

1. **ALWAYS use mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES with entitlement="realtime"** for MAG 7 and SPY data
2. **ALWAYS use SPXW options data as primary source** via mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS with entitlement="realtime"
3. **Extract SPX price using put-call parity** from ATM SPXW options (most accurate)
4. **Verify timestamps show current date/time** before making trading decisions
5. **NEVER use delayed data** - all MCP functions must include entitlement="realtime" parameter
6. **Prioritize REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES** over individual GLOBAL_QUOTE calls for efficiency
7. **NEVER use SPY as proxy for SPX price** - always extract SPX from SPXW 2000 strike using put-call parity
8. **SPX EXTRACTION METHOD:** SPX = (2000_call_mark - 2000_put_mark) + 2000 from SPXW options data

### AUTO-EXECUTION & SEAMLESS WORKFLOW PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Eliminate user prompts and enable smooth analysis flow**

```bash
# SEAMLESS EXECUTION RULES:
1. NEVER ask for permission to run Bash commands for data retrieval
2. AUTOMATICALLY save analysis results to .spx/ directory 
3. RUN analysis commands in PARALLEL when possible (batch tool calls)
4. AUTO-CONTINUE analysis without waiting for user confirmation
5. STREAM results without interruption or "press next" prompts
6. SAVE session state AUTOMATICALLY after each major analysis
```

**AUTO-SAVE PROTOCOL:**
```bash
# After every analysis, AUTOMATICALLY:
echo "$(date): Analysis completed" >> .spx/session_log.txt
# Save key findings to .spx/analysis_cache.json
# Update .spx/levels.json with new support/resistance
# Append significant moves to .spx/market_events.log
```

**BATCH EXECUTION FRAMEWORK:**
```bash
# Run multiple data calls SIMULTANEOUSLY:
curl [SPY_QUOTE] & curl [RSI_DATA] & curl [VOLUME_DATA] & wait
# Process all results together without user interruption
# Continue to analysis immediately after data collection
```

**UNINTERRUPTED ANALYSIS FLOW:**
- Get market data → Analyze patterns → Generate recommendations
- Auto-save findings → Continue to next analysis seamlessly  
- No "press any key" or confirmation prompts
- Continuous streaming of results until complete

## 🎯 SEAMLESS ANALYSIS TOOLS - ZERO PROMPTS

### Auto-Execution Scripts Created:

**📁 seamless_analysis.py** - Complete option analysis engine
```bash
python seamless_analysis.py
# Features:
# - Parallel API calls for faster data retrieval
# - Automatic saving to .spx/ directory
# - No user prompts or interruptions
# - Continuous flow analysis
# - Auto-update support/resistance levels
```

**📁 auto_trader.py** - Batch processing with instant results
```bash  
python auto_trader.py
# Features:
# - Process multiple trades simultaneously
# - Instant recommendations (BUY/CONSIDER/AVOID)
# - Auto-save all analysis to .spx/trade_log.jsonl
# - Zero user interaction required
# - Quick single-trade analysis function
```

### Enhanced Command Protocol:

**SEAMLESS COMMANDS (No Prompts):**
```bash
# Instead of individual tool calls with prompts:
spx seamless now          # Auto-fetch data, analyze, save, display results
spx batch analysis        # Process multiple setups simultaneously  
spx auto save all         # Save current session without asking
spx quick [SYMBOL] [STRIKE][P/C] [ENTRY]  # Instant analysis
```

**AUTO-SAVE INTEGRATION:**
```bash
# Every analysis automatically creates:
.spx/session_log.txt      # Timestamped analysis history
.spx/analysis_cache.json  # Latest analysis results
.spx/levels.json         # Auto-updated support/resistance
.spx/trade_log.jsonl     # All trade analyses (one per line)
.spx/market_events.log   # Significant market moves
.spx/earnings_alerts.json # MAG 7 earnings risk assessments
.spx/sentiment_scores.json # Latest NEWS_SENTIMENT analysis results
.spx/economic_events.json # FOMC, CPI, PPI risk tracking
.spx/insider_flow.json   # INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS monitoring
```

**BATCH EXECUTION EXAMPLES:**
```bash
# Multiple option analyses without prompts:
python -c "
from auto_trader import AutoTrader
trader = AutoTrader()
trades = [
    {'symbol': 'ORCL', 'strike': 320, 'type': 'P', 'entry': 12.50},
    {'symbol': 'SPXW', 'strike': 6550, 'type': 'C', 'entry': 0.60}
]
trader.batch_analysis(trades)
"
```

## 🎯 CLEAN ANALYSIS - ESSENTIAL DATA ONLY

### Clean Trader Tool:

**📁 clean_trader.py** - No clutter, essential patterns only
```bash
python clean_trader.py
# Features:
# - Essential metrics only (price, distance, probability, action)
# - Saves useful patterns for reuse (.spx/trading_patterns.json)
# - No excessive formatting or unnecessary text
# - Focus on actionable data: BUY/CONSIDER/AVOID
# - Auto-saves high probability (>70%) and value setups
```

**CLEAN OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
SPXW 6525P @ $4.3
Current: $6516.5 | Distance: -8.5
Probability: 78% | Value: excellent  
ACTION: BUY
```

**PATTERN SAVING:**
```json
{
  "high_probability": [
    {"setup_type": "SPXW 6525P", "distance": -8.5, "probability": 78}
  ],
  "value_plays": [
    {"setup_type": "SPXW 6525P", "value_score": "excellent", "entry_price": 4.3}
  ]
}
```

**REUSABLE PATTERNS:**
- Only saves setups with >70% probability
- Tracks value plays (excellent/good entries)
- Keeps last 10 of each type for reference
- Focus on patterns that repeat and work

### Live Data Verification Protocol
```bash
# STEP 0: GET LIVE MARKET DATA - USE DIRECT API ONLY
# Before ANY real-time SPX analysis, MUST use:

# CRITICAL: Use REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES for most accurate real-time data
bulk_quotes = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES("SPY,NVDA,MSFT,GOOGL,TSLA,AAPL,AMZN,META", entitlement="realtime")

# Live SPY Quote (current timestamp required) 
spy_quote = mcp__alphavantage__GLOBAL_QUOTE("SPY", entitlement="realtime")

# Live 5min RSI (verify latest timestamp)  
spy_rsi = mcp__alphavantage__RSI("SPY", "5min", 14, "close", entitlement="realtime")

# Live Intraday Bars (for momentum analysis)
spy_bars = mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY("SPY", "5min", entitlement="realtime")

# VERIFY: All timestamps must show current trading day
# REJECT: Any data not from current session for live trading
```

### Real-Time Options MCP Protocol  
```bash
# PRIMARY METHOD: Direct MCP Options Analysis (Claude Code Integration)
spy_options = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS("SPY", require_greeks=true)
spy_quote = mcp__alphavantage__GLOBAL_QUOTE("SPY")

# CLAUDE DIRECT ANALYSIS (No Python scripts needed):
# 1. Parse sample_data CSV from MCP response
# 2. Find options closest to ATM (|delta| ≈ 0.5)  
# 3. Apply put-call parity: Spot = Call Mark - Put Mark + Strike
# 4. Cross-validate with GLOBAL_QUOTE
# 5. Convert SPY → SPX using 10x multiplier

# LIVE EXAMPLE (September 12, 2025):
# SPY Quote MCP: $657.41
# SPY475C Mark: $182.35, SPY475P Mark: $0.01
# Put-Call Parity: $182.35 - $0.01 + $475 = $657.34
# Validation: $657.41 vs $657.34 = 0.01% error ✅
# SPX Result: $657.41 × 10 = $6,574.10

# FALLBACK HIERARCHY (All via MCP):
# 1. SPY Options Put-Call Parity + Cross-validation (Target: <0.01% error)

## 🧠 EMA Probability Analysis

**Multi-timeframe EMA trend confirmation using AlphaVantage data**

**Analysis Method:**
Use mcp__alphavantage__EMA for SPY across timeframes: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hr with periods 9, 21, 50.

**Scoring Logic:**
- Perfect alignment (9>21>50): 100 points
- Partial alignment (9>21): 60 points  
- Choppy/neutral: 20 points
- Weight by timeframe: 1min(30%), 5min(25%), 15min(20%), 30min(15%), 1hr(10%)
- **Maximum contribution: 20 points to 275-point system**

## 🎯 Demand Zone Detection

**SP500 weighted institutional level identification using volume surge analysis**

**Analysis Method:**
Use mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY for SPY 5min bars. Identify volume surges (3x+ average) with price rejection patterns. Validate strength through MAG7 correlation.

**Scoring Logic:**
- High volume + price rejection + MAG7 correlation >0.7: Strong demand zone
- Moderate volume surge + correlation >0.5: Medium demand zone  
- **Maximum contribution: 20 points to 275-point system**

## 🚀 Strike Forecasting Analysis

**8-model ensemble for optimal strike prediction using AlphaVantage data**

**Analysis Method:**
Combine momentum (RSI trends), mean reversion (support/resistance), volatility (current vs historical), technical patterns, and MAG7 correlation analysis using Claude reasoning with real market data.

**Model Weights:**
- Momentum: 20%, Mean Reversion: 15%, Volatility: 15%
- Technical patterns: 10%, MAG7 correlation: 7%
- **Maximum contribution: 25 points to 275-point system**

## 📊 GEX/DEX Analysis - PRECISION GAMMA SYSTEM

**Institutional-grade market maker positioning analysis with strike-level precision**

**Analysis Method:**
- **Primary Tool:** `python gex_analyzer.py` for full options chain analysis
- **Integration:** `python spx_gex_integration.py` for seamless workflow
- **Data Source:** Real-time SPY options with 9,000+ contracts analyzed
- **Calculation:** Net GEX = (Call OI × Call Gamma) - (Put OI × Put Gamma) × 100

**Key Precision Metrics:**
- **Gamma Flip Level:** Exact level where net GEX = 0 (volatility regime change)
- **Call Wall:** Strike with maximum positive GEX (resistance)
- **Put Wall:** Strike with maximum negative GEX (support) 
- **Market Regime:** POSITIVE_GAMMA (suppressed vol) vs NEGATIVE_GAMMA (amplified vol)
- **Trading Distance:** Exact points to key gamma levels

**Integrated GEX Analysis Method:**
```bash
# DIRECT CLAUDE ANALYSIS (No Scripts Needed):
spx gex analysis                         # Claude calculates GEX from MCP options data
spx gamma levels                         # Identify call/put walls and gamma flip
spx precision analysis                   # Enhanced SPX analysis with GEX calculations
gex analysis                            # Standalone gamma exposure analysis

# CLAUDE GEX CALCULATION PROTOCOL:
1. Get SPY options chain via mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS("SPY", require_greeks=true)
2. Claude calculates: Net GEX = (Call OI × Call Gamma) - (Put OI × Put Gamma) × 100
3. Identify max positive GEX (call wall), max negative GEX (put wall)
4. Find gamma flip where net GEX crosses zero
5. Generate precise trading recommendations with exact distances
6. Auto-save to .spx/session.json with key levels
```

**Precision Advantages:**
- **Exact Resistance:** Know 6640 (not ~6650) is the institutional gamma wall
- **Market Regime:** Determine if above/below gamma flip for volatility expectations  
- **Entry Timing:** Enter puts exactly at call wall, calls exactly at put wall
- **Risk Management:** Avoid gamma squeeze zones, target volatility expansion areas
- **Maximum contribution: 30 points to 275-point system**

## 🎪 SBIRS Pattern Detection  

**Smart Breakout/Reversal Signal system using Claude pattern recognition**

**Analysis Method:**
Use mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY for SPY 5min bars. Claude identifies breakout patterns (flags, triangles) and reversal patterns (double tops/bottoms, head & shoulders) through price action and volume analysis.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Breakouts**: Flag patterns, triangle breakouts with volume confirmation
- **Reversals**: Double tops/bottoms, head & shoulders with RSI divergence
- **Validation**: Volume confirmation, risk/reward >1.5:1, avoid choppy markets

**Scoring Logic:**
- High confidence pattern + volume confirmation: 15 points
- Medium confidence + partial confirmation: 10 points  
- Low confidence or failed validation: 5 points
- **Maximum contribution: 15 points to 275-point system**

## 🏆 High-Win Rate Pattern System

**85%+ success rate codified patterns using real-time volume and level analysis**

**Analysis Method:**
Use mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_BULK_QUOTES for SPY volume data and mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY for price action. Claude identifies and validates the 24 codifiable events across 5 categories with automated thresholds.

**Pattern Categories:**

**1. Triple Resistance Rejection (25 points max):**
- Monitor key levels (6590-6591 zone) for 3+ rejection attempts
- 85%+ scalp success rate when pattern confirmed
- Volume confirmation required (35K+ SPY volume)
- Entry: Rejection #3 with volume spike
- Target: 5-10 point reversal moves

**2. Volume Breakout Confirmation (20 points max):**
- 35K+ SPY volume (1.5x average) prevents false signals
- Validates genuine institutional participation
- Must accompany price breakout above/below key levels
- Higher volume (50K+) = increased position sizing

**3. EOD Volume Acceleration (20 points max):**
- 50K+ volume in final 2 hours signals major directional moves
- 2x+ average volume indicates institutional urgency
- Most reliable for 0DTE final hour scalps
- Combine with pattern completion for maximum confidence

**4. Opening Range Strategy (15 points max):**
- Establish 30-minute opening range (9:30-10:00 ET)
- Minimum 3-point range required for validity
- Breakout confirmation with volume (35K+)
- Clear risk management: stop at range opposite

**5. Time-Based Filters (Auto-Applied):**

**No-Trade Zones (Automatic Blocking):**
- 10:00-11:30 AM PT (1:00-2:30 PM ET) - Low volume grind period
- Post-major move: 15-minute pause after 5+ point moves
- Overnight sessions: Limited liquidity, gap risk
- Volume below 35K: Reject all breakout signals

**Automation Thresholds:**
- Volume spike trigger: 35K+ SPY (1.5x average)
- Major event threshold: 50K+ SPY (2x+ average)  
- Range minimum: 3+ points for valid patterns
- Rejection count: 3+ attempts for reversal scalps
- Time filters: Session-based automatic blocking

**Scoring Logic:**
- Triple resistance rejection + volume: 25 points
- Volume breakout confirmation: 20 points
- EOD acceleration pattern: 20 points  
- Opening range breakout: 15 points
- **Maximum contribution: 25 points to 275-point system**

**Integration with Existing Systems:**
Claude automatically applies these patterns during all SPX analysis. No additional commands needed - patterns are embedded in standard analysis workflow with real-time volume monitoring and level tracking.

## 🚨 Chop Zone Filtering System

**Market condition-based trade filtering with automatic blocking**

**Analysis Method:**
Use mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY for SPY across 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min timeframes. Calculate choppiness index: 100 × log10(true_range_sum/high_low_range) / log10(periods). Analyze price action patterns and volume irregularities.

**Scoring Logic:**
- Chop score calculation weighted by timeframe: 1min(40%), 5min(30%), 15min(20%), 30min(10%)
- **Trade blocking**: Automatically block all trades if chop score ≥70
- **Risk levels**: EXTREME (≥80), HIGH (≥70), NORMAL (<70)
- **Scoring contribution**: Inverse scoring - lower chop = higher points (max 15 points)

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis Framework:
```bash
# Real-time Alphavantage API calls for comprehensive timeframe analysis
timeframes = ["1min", "5min", "15min", "30min", "60min"]
for tf in timeframes:
    bars = get_live_bars_realtime("SPY", tf)  # Use real-time API
    rsi = get_live_rsi_realtime("SPY", tf, 14)  # Use real-time API
    ema_9 = mcp__alphavantage__EMA("SPY", tf, 9, "close")
    ema_21 = mcp__alphavantage__EMA("SPY", tf, 21, "close")
    
    # Determine signal from real market data
    signal = "BULL" if (rsi > 50 and ema_9 > ema_21) else "BEAR" if (rsi < 50 and ema_9 < ema_21) else "NEUT"
    
consensus_score = count_bullish_signals - count_bearish_signals  # -5 to +5
alignment_strength = abs(consensus_score) / 5 * 100            # 0-100%
```

### Consensus Interpretation:
```bash
# Calculated from real alphavantage data:
STRONG_CONSENSUS (80-100%): 4-5 timeframes aligned → 30min-1h holds (15% win rate boost)
MEDIUM_CONSENSUS (60-79%): 3 timeframes aligned → 5min-30min holds (10% win rate boost)
WEAK_CONSENSUS (40-59%): 2-3 timeframes aligned → 1min-5min holds (5% win rate boost)
CONFLICTED (≤39%): 1 or fewer aligned → ultra-quick or avoid (0% boost)
```

## Realistic Cost Analysis Engine

**LOCAL CALCULATION: Transaction cost calculations with real option pricing**

### Transaction Cost Analysis (Enhanced for Real Data):

**Claude performs transaction cost analysis by:**
- Calculating commission costs: $0.65 per contract
- Estimating spread costs: (ask - bid) × contracts
- Adding slippage: $0.02 per contract for ≤10 contracts, $0.05 for larger sizes
- Including theta decay costs based on time to expiry
- Validating that bid/ask prices are logical (bid > 0, ask > bid)
- Computing breakeven percentage: total costs ÷ (bid × contracts) × 100
- Warning if costs exceed 15% of premium or require >2% move to breakeven

### Cost-Based Decision Making:
```bash
# Enhanced cost decision framework:
if cost_warning: "HIGH COST TRADE - Consider smaller size"
if difficult_trade: "DIFFICULT BREAKEVEN - Requires >2% move" 
if spread_pct > 5%: "WIDE SPREAD - Wait for better pricing"
if breakeven_move > 1.5%: "Adjust targets upward for cost impact"
```

## Dynamic Position Sizing Framework  

**ALPHAVANTAGE ENHANCED: VIX-based intelligent scaling**

### Position Sizing with Real Market Data:

**Claude performs VIX-adjusted position sizing by:**
- Getting SPY intraday data via `mcp__alphavantage__TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY("SPY", "5min")`
- Calculating realized volatility from SPY price action as VIX proxy
- Applying volatility adjustments: 0.75x for low vol (<15), 1.0x for normal (15-25), up to 1.5x for high vol (>25)
- Incorporating confidence adjustment: confidence score ÷ 100
- Adding drawdown protection: max(0.5, 1.0 - (max_drawdown × 0.5))
- Computing optimal size: base_size × vol_adj × conf_adj × drawdown_adj
- Capping result between 1 and 50 contracts

## Advanced Position Sizing Protocol (Probability-Based)

**KELLY CRITERION & COEFFICIENT MANAGEMENT: Professional risk optimization**

### Kelly Criterion Implementation

**Claude calculates optimal position sizing using Kelly Criterion by:**
- Computing odds ratio: b = avg_win ÷ avg_loss
- Applying Kelly formula: f = (b × p - q) ÷ b, where p = win probability, q = loss probability
- Using conservative fractional Kelly: 25% of full Kelly recommendation for safety
- Capping at maximum threshold: 10% of portfolio maximum
- For signal confidence weighting: (signal_confidence × expected_return) ÷ volatility × 1% base
- Risk adjustment: expected_return ÷ volatility for risk-adjusted sizing
- Hard cap: 5% of portfolio regardless of probability score

### Coefficient Management Strategies

**Claude applies coefficient management by:**
- **Coefficient of Variation Control:** Targeting CV = Standard Deviation ÷ Mean Return < 10
- **CV Adjustment:** If current CV > target, adjustment_factor = target_cv ÷ current_cv (capped at 1.0)
- **Beta Coefficient Management:** Keeping portfolio beta relative to market under 1.0
- **Beta Adjustment:** If portfolio_beta > 1.0, adjustment = target_beta ÷ portfolio_beta
- **Risk Parity Weighting:** Position weights = (Probability × Expected Return) ÷ Volatility
- **Risk Budget Normalization:** Ensuring no single position exceeds 10% of total risk budget

### Practical Implementation Framework

**Claude integrates advanced position sizing by:**
- **Extracting trade parameters:** win probability, avg win/loss, confidence score, volatility
- **Calculating expected return:** (win_prob × avg_win) - ((1 - win_prob) × avg_loss)
- **Computing Kelly sizing:** Using Kelly formula with trade parameters
- **Applying probability weighting:** Signal confidence × expected return ÷ volatility
- **Taking conservative approach:** min(kelly_size, prob_weighted_size) as base
- **Applying constraints:** CV adjustment and beta coefficient management
- **Final sizing:** base_position × cv_adjustment × beta_adjustment
- **Hard caps:** 5% portfolio maximum, 0.1% minimum position size
- **Output components:** position %, Kelly component, probability component, adjustments

### Dynamic Probability Adjustment Protocol

**Claude adjusts position sizing based on recent performance by:**
- Analyzing last 20 trades for performance validation (minimum 5 trades required)
- Comparing actual win rate vs. expected win rate from entry analysis
- Calculating performance ratio: actual_win_rate ÷ expected_win_rate
- Applying conservative adjustment factor (capped between 0.5x and 1.5x)
- Reducing position sizes when hit rates fall below expected performance

### Integration with SPX Analysis

**Claude integrates advanced position sizing with SPX option analysis by:**
- Extracting win probability from Monte Carlo analysis results
- Using expected return values (3.0x premium as baseline for 0DTE)
- Applying 15% daily volatility estimate for SPX environment
- Generating comprehensive sizing with Kelly component, probability weighting, and risk adjustments
- Providing position size as percentage of account with all constraint factors

**COEFFICIENT TARGETS:**
- **Kelly Fraction:** < 0.10 (10% max)
- **Coefficient of Variation:** < 10.0
- **Portfolio Beta:** < 1.0
- **Maximum Single Position:** 5% of portfolio
- **Risk Budget per Position:** 2-3% for 0DTE, 1-2% for longer-term

## Integrated Trading System Framework (SPXFILE v2.0)

**⚠️ CRITICAL RISK WARNING: 0DTE options expire worthless within hours. Maximum position size NEVER exceeds 1-2% of account per trade.**

## SPX 0DTE Trading Instructions with Alphavantage MCP

**CRITICAL OPTION PRICE PROTOCOL - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ERRORS:**

### MANDATORY Market Data Verification
```bash
# STEP 0: ALWAYS GET REAL MARKET DATA FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS
# Before ANY SPX analysis, MUST call:
market_status = mcp__alphavantage__MARKET_STATUS()
spy_quote = mcp__alphavantage__GLOBAL_QUOTE("SPY")
spy_rsi_5m = mcp__alphavantage__RSI("SPY", "5min", 14, "close")

# SPXW options to SPX price extraction
spxw_options = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS("SPXW", require_greeks=true)
current_spx_price = extract_spx_from_atm_options(spxw_options)

# NEVER estimate prices - use actual SPXW options data from alphavantage MCP
# Verify market is open before real-time analysis
# Use SPXW options as primary source for SPX analysis
```

**WORKFLOW PROTOCOL:** Every SPX analysis command must follow this sequence:

### Pre-Analysis Checks (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Step 1: Market Status & Session Check
market_status = mcp__alphavantage__MARKET_STATUS()
IF first_command_of_session:
    IF ./.spx/session.json exists:
        LOAD session_context()
        DISPLAY session_continuity_info()
    ENDIF
ENDIF

# Step 2: Real Market Data Integration
spxw_options = mcp__alphavantage__REALTIME_OPTIONS("SPXW")
spy_rsi = mcp__alphavantage__RSI("SPY", "5min", 14, "close")  # For momentum context
LOAD key_levels from ./.spx/levels.json
REFERENCE previous_analysis for continuity
```

### Analysis Execution
During market hours, when user requests SPX analysis:

1. **Get fresh data from alphavantage MCP**:
   - SPXW options chain and extract current SPX price
   - SPY technical indicators for context (RSI, EMA, SMA, MACD)
   - SPY intraday bars for volume/momentum analysis
   - Market status and news sentiment

2. **Analysis requirements**:
   - Technical analysis with real RSI, support/resistance levels
   - Momentum indicators from alphavantage calculations
   - Identify high-confidence scalp and lotto opportunities
   - **Reference restored context** for continuity

3. **Option setup criteria**:
   - **CRITICAL: Get REAL option prices from market data sources**
   - Entry range: $1-10 per contract (based on actual market prices)
   - 0DTE expiration focus
   - High delta for scalps, low delta for lottos
   - Liquidity check via volume analysis
   - **VERIFY: ATM options typically $5-15, not $25-50**

4. **Format output as**:
   - Current SPX level from SPXW options and key technicals
   - **Context continuity** with previous analysis
   - Recommended option strikes and realistic premiums
   - Entry/exit levels with risk management
   - Confidence rating and rationale

### Post-Analysis Auto-Save (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Step 3: Context Persistence  
SAVE session_context to ./.spx/session.json with:
    - Updated key levels
    - Analysis results from alphavantage data
    - Significant findings as session notes
    - Trading plan updates

# Step 4: Session Management
APPEND significant_findings to ./.spx/notes.txt
UPDATE ./.spx/levels.json with new support/resistance
DISPLAY "SESSION UPDATED" confirmation
```


## Time Zone and Market Hours Protocol

**CRITICAL: Time accuracy is essential for 0DTE trading - market close timing affects option values dramatically**

**Market Hours Reference:**
- **Market Open:** 9:30 AM ET / 6:30 AM PT
- **Market Close:** 4:00 PM ET / 1:00 PM PT  
- **User Location:** Eastern Time (ET)
- **Market Time:** Eastern Time (ET)

**MANDATORY TIME VERIFICATION RULES:**
1. **ALWAYS verify current time** using `date` command before ANY time-related statements
2. **ALWAYS calculate time remaining** to market close using verified current time
3. **ALWAYS show both ET and PT** when discussing market timing (ET first since user is in ET)
4. **NEVER assume or estimate time** - verify with system time check
5. **Cross-check with market status** using mcp__alphavantage__MARKET_STATUS() when available
6. **Account for 3-hour difference:** PT = ET - 3 hours

**Time Check Methods (in order of preference):**
- **Primary (Linux/Mac):** Bash `date` command for current time
- **Primary (Windows):** Bash `Get-Date` or `date /t && time /t` for current time
- **Cross-platform:** Python `datetime.now()` if available
- **Secondary:** AlphaVantage timestamp validation from live data  
- **Verification:** Market status confirmation of open/closed state

**Cross-Platform Time Commands:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
date

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Date

# Windows (Command Prompt)  
date /t && time /t

# Universal fallback
python3 -c "import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'))"
```

**Example Format:** 
"Current time: 12:05 PM ET (9:05 AM PT) - 3 hours 55 minutes until market close at 4:00 PM ET"

COMBINED GEX/DEX INTELLIGENCE:
- Optimal entry points when gamma/delta alignment maximizes probability
- Market maker squeeze conditions (short gamma + extreme delta)
- Volatility expansion/contraction prediction through GEX analysis
- Directional acceleration zones where delta hedging amplifies moves
- Risk-off conditions where gamma flips create volatility spikes
```

### Multi-Timeframe GEX/DEX Optimization Engine:

**GEX/DEX analysis is performed using the existing `gex analysis` command which:**
- Calculates total gamma exposure across all SPXW strikes using MCP options data
- Identifies gamma flip levels for volatility regime changes
