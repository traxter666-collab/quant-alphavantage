## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Create Discord Webhooks**

For each channel you want to use, create a webhook in Discord:

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Right-click the channel (e.g., #trading-performance)
3. Click "Edit Channel" â†’ "Integrations" â†’ "Webhooks"
4. Click "New Webhook"
5. Copy the webhook URL

### **Step 2: Update Configuration**

Edit `discord_config.json` and replace the placeholder webhooks:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "alerts": {
      "webhook": "YOUR_CURRENT_WEBHOOK_HERE",
      "description": "Main trading alerts and market updates",
      "username": "Trading Monitor Bot"
    },
    "performance": {
      "webhook": "PASTE_PERFORMANCE_WEBHOOK_HERE",
      "description": "Trade performance, P&L, analytics",
      "username": "Performance Tracker"
    },
    "research": {
      "webhook": "PASTE_RESEARCH_WEBHOOK_HERE",
      "description": "Market research, backtest results, strategy optimization",
      "username": "Research Bot"

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Existing Scripts

Update your scripts to use the new multi-channel system:

```python
import subprocess

# Send to alerts channel (trading signals)
subprocess.run([
    'python', 'send_discord_multi.py',
    'SPX Alert', 'Current: $6651.20',
    'alerts'
])

# Send to performance channel (trade results)
subprocess.run([
    'python', 'send_discord_multi.py',
    'Trade Closed', 'Profit: +$1,250',
    'performance'
])

# Send to research channel (backtest results)
subprocess.run([
    'python', 'send_discord_multi.py',
    'Backtest Complete', 'Win rate: 75%',
    'research'
])

# Send to system channel (errors/status)
subprocess.run([
    'python', 'send_discord_multi.py',
    'System Ready', 'All tests passed',
    'system'
])
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Automatic Channel Selection

The system automatically:
- Routes trading alerts to `alerts` channel by default
- Uses color coding based on message type and channel
- Includes channel name in footer for clarity
- Falls back to default channel if webhook not configured
- Validates channel names before sending

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Keep `discord_config.json` private (don't commit to public repos)
- Each webhook can be revoked independently if compromised
- Different webhooks allow granular permission control
- Consider separate servers for production vs testing

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Priority-based routing (critical â†’ alerts, info â†’ system)
- Message templates by channel type
- Rate limiting per channel
- Channel-specific retry logic
- Webhook health monitoring
