## üéØ EXAMPLE TRADE SETUP WITH ALL ENHANCEMENTS

**SPX King Node: 24750 CALL WALL (99% strength)**

**Volume Analysis:**
- Volume Ratio: 1.6x (HIGH)
- Volume Multiplier: 1.3x
- Confidence Boost: +15 points

**Zone Classification:**
- Zone: REJECTION_ZONE (1-4 points from king node)
- Base Position Size: 1.5%

**Touch Sequence:**
- Touch Count: 0 (UNTESTED)
- Touch Multiplier: 1.25x

**King Node Strength:**
- Strength: 99%
- Strength Multiplier: 1.2x

**Migration Context:**
- Migration: UPWARD (24700 ‚Üí 24750)
- Significance: HIGH
- Bias: BULLISH
- Confidence Boost: +15 points

**Final Calculation:**
- Base Confidence: 77%
- Volume Boost: +15 points = 92%
- Migration Boost: +15 points = 107% (capped at 100%)
- Final Confidence: 100%

**Position Size:**
- 1.5% √ó 1.3 √ó 1.25 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.0 = 2.925%
- **Capped at 2.0% (maximum position size)**

**Size Reasoning:**
REJECTION_ZONE base: 1.5% √ó HIGH volume (1.3x) √ó Untested level (1.25x) √ó 99% king node strength (1.2x) √ó Confidence 100% (1.0x) = 2.0%
