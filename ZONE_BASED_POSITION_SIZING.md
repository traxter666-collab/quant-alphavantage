# 📊 King Node Zone-Based Position Sizing Enhancement

## 📅 Enhancement Date: October 2, 2025

---

## 🎯 ENHANCEMENT OVERVIEW

**Objective:** Implement zone-based position sizing to optimize risk-reward by adjusting position sizes based on distance from king nodes and confidence levels.

**Problem Identified:**
Current system uses fixed position sizing (0.5-1.5% of account) regardless of setup quality. This leaves significant opportunity on the table for high-confidence rejection zone trades while potentially over-risking in lower-confidence far zone setups.

**Solution:**
Implement dynamic position sizing that scales based on:
1. **Distance Zone** - Closer to king node = higher conviction
2. **Volume Confirmation** - Higher volume = larger position
3. **Touch Sequence** - Untested levels = higher confidence
4. **King Node Strength** - 99% strength = maximum size

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Zone-Based Position Sizing Logic

**Base Position Sizes by Zone:**

```python
ZONE_BASE_SIZES = {
    'REJECTION_ZONE': 1.5,      # 0-4 points: Highest conviction
    'CAUTION_ZONE': 1.0,         # 5-9 points: Medium conviction
    'GATEKEEPER_ZONE': 1.2,      # 10-24 points: Good conviction
    'FAR_ZONE': 1.0,             # 25+ points: Standard conviction
    'AT_NODE': 0.5               # 0-2 points: Too close, reduce size
}
```

**Volume Multipliers:**

```python
VOLUME_MULTIPLIERS = {
    'HIGH': 1.3,        # 1.5x+ volume: Strong institutional confirmation
    'MODERATE': 1.15,   # 1.2-1.5x volume: Good confirmation
    'NORMAL': 1.0,      # 0.8-1.3x volume: Standard
    'LOW': 0.7          # <0.8x volume: Weak signal, reduce size
}
```

**Touch Sequence Multipliers:**

```python
TOUCH_MULTIPLIERS = {
    'UNTESTED': 1.25,    # No previous touches: Highest probability
    'FIRST_TOUCH': 1.1,  # First test: Good probability
    'SECOND_TOUCH': 1.0, # Retest: Normal probability
    'THIRD_PLUS': 0.8    # Multiple tests: Overused level
}
```

**King Node Strength Multipliers:**

```python
STRENGTH_MULTIPLIERS = {
    99: 1.2,   # 99% strength: Maximum conviction
    95: 1.1,   # 95-98% strength: High conviction
    90: 1.0,   # 90-94% strength: Good conviction
    85: 0.9    # 85-89% strength: Adequate conviction
}
```

### Position Sizing Calculation Method

```python
def calculate_zone_based_position_size(self, zone, volume_ratio, touch_count,
                                        king_node_strength, base_confidence):
    """
    Calculate optimal position size based on zone characteristics

    Returns: position_size (percentage of account), reasoning
    """
    # Start with zone base size
    base_size = ZONE_BASE_SIZES.get(zone, 1.0)

    # Apply volume multiplier
    if volume_ratio >= 1.5:
        volume_mult = VOLUME_MULTIPLIERS['HIGH']
        volume_reason = f"HIGH volume ({volume_ratio:.1f}x)"
    elif volume_ratio >= 1.2:
        volume_mult = VOLUME_MULTIPLIERS['MODERATE']
        volume_reason = f"MODERATE volume ({volume_ratio:.1f}x)"
    elif volume_ratio >= 0.8:
        volume_mult = VOLUME_MULTIPLIERS['NORMAL']
        volume_reason = f"Normal volume ({volume_ratio:.1f}x)"
    else:
        volume_mult = VOLUME_MULTIPLIERS['LOW']
        volume_reason = f"LOW volume ({volume_ratio:.1f}x)"

    # Apply touch sequence multiplier
    if touch_count == 0:
        touch_mult = TOUCH_MULTIPLIERS['UNTESTED']
        touch_reason = "Untested level"
    elif touch_count == 1:
        touch_mult = TOUCH_MULTIPLIERS['FIRST_TOUCH']
        touch_reason = "First touch"
    elif touch_count == 2:
        touch_mult = TOUCH_MULTIPLIERS['SECOND_TOUCH']
        touch_reason = "Second touch"
    else:
        touch_mult = TOUCH_MULTIPLIERS['THIRD_PLUS']
        touch_reason = f"{touch_count} touches (overused)"

    # Apply king node strength multiplier
    if king_node_strength >= 99:
        strength_mult = STRENGTH_MULTIPLIERS[99]
        strength_reason = f"99% king node strength"
    elif king_node_strength >= 95:
        strength_mult = STRENGTH_MULTIPLIERS[95]
        strength_reason = f"{king_node_strength}% strength"
    elif king_node_strength >= 90:
        strength_mult = STRENGTH_MULTIPLIERS[90]
        strength_reason = f"{king_node_strength}% strength"
    else:
        strength_mult = STRENGTH_MULTIPLIERS[85]
        strength_reason = f"{king_node_strength}% strength (adequate)"

    # Calculate final position size
    position_size = base_size * volume_mult * touch_mult * strength_mult

    # Apply confidence scaling
    confidence_mult = base_confidence / 100
    position_size *= confidence_mult

    # Hard caps
    position_size = min(position_size, 2.0)  # Maximum 2% per trade
    position_size = max(position_size, 0.3)  # Minimum 0.3% per trade

    # Build reasoning
    reasoning = (
        f"{zone} base: {base_size}% × "
        f"{volume_reason} ({volume_mult}x) × "
        f"{touch_reason} ({touch_mult}x) × "
        f"{strength_reason} ({strength_mult}x) × "
        f"Confidence {base_confidence}% ({confidence_mult:.2f}x) = "
        f"{position_size:.2f}%"
    )

    return position_size, reasoning

**Example 3: AT_NODE + LOW VOLUME + THIRD TOUCH + 85% STRENGTH**
- Base: 0.5% (at node - too close)
- Volume: 0.7x (low volume)
- Touch: 0.8x (overused level)
- Strength: 0.9x (85% strength)
