## 🔍 Technical Analysis Components

### 1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
**What it tells us:**
- Oversold (30-40): Potential bounce setup
- Normal (40-60): Neutral momentum
- Overbought (60-70): Strong momentum but watch for reversal
- Extreme (>70 or <30): Caution zone

**Scoring:**
- Oversold bounce setup: +25 points
- Strong momentum zone: +20 points
- Extreme zones: +10-15 points

### 2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
**What it tells us:**
- Bullish crossover (MACD > Signal, both positive): Strong buy signal
- Bullish turn (MACD > Signal, both negative): Early reversal
- Bearish crossover: Potential short or avoid long

**Scoring:**
- Bullish crossover above zero: +25 points
- Bullish crossover below zero: +20 points
- Bearish signal: +15 points (contrarian opportunity)

### 3. EMA Structure (9, 21, 50)
**What it tells us:**
- Bullish alignment (9>21>50): Uptrend confirmed
- Near crossover: Potential trend change
- Bearish alignment: Downtrend

**Scoring:**
- Perfect bullish alignment: +25 points
- Near crossover: +20 points
- Other configurations: +10 points

### 4. Volume Analysis
**What it tells us:**
- >2.0x average: Institutional activity, high conviction

- <1.0x average: Weak participation

**Scoring:**
- >2.0x volume: +30 points (institutional signature)
- >1.5x volume: +25 points
- >1.0x volume: +15 points
- <1.0x volume: +5 points

### 5. Level 2/3 Data (Polygon API)
**What it tells us:**
- Tight spread (<0.1%): High liquidity, easy execution
- Wide spread (>0.5%): Low liquidity warning
- Bid/ask imbalance: Directional pressure indication

**Scoring:**
- Tight spread + strong bid: +35 points
- Normal spread: +10 points
- Wide spread or weak liquidity: -10 points

*Note: Requires Polygon API key. Set as environment variable:*
```bash
export POLYGON_API_KEY="your_key_here"  # Linux/Mac
set POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here       # Windows
```

### 6. Momentum Analysis
**What it tells us:**
- Multi-day trend strength
- Acceleration or deceleration

- >1% today + >5% 5-day: +30 points (moderate trend)
- Mixed momentum: +5-15 points

### 7. Strike Relationship
**What it tells us:**
- For calls bought: How far to strike (easier = higher score)
- For puts sold: How much cushion (more = higher score)

**Scoring for Calls:**
- 0-5% OTM: 80 points (excellent strike)
- 5-10% OTM: 60 points (good strike)
- ITM: 70 points (high conviction)

## 📈 Interpretation Guide

### When TA Score is HIGH (≥75):
✅ **Underlying is primed for movement**
✅ **Multiple technical confirmations**
✅ **High institutional activity**
✅ **Good liquidity for entry/exit**
✅ **Risk/reward is favorable**

**Action:** Strong conviction trade, increase position size

### When TA Score is GOOD (60-74):
✅ **Most technicals aligned**
⚠️ **Some mixed signals**
✅ **Decent setup quality**

**Action:** Normal position sizing, monitor closely

### When TA Score is FAIR (45-59):
⚠️ **Mixed technical signals**
⚠️ **May not be primed for immediate move**
⚠️ **Lower probability setup**

**Action:** Small position or wait for better entry

### When TA Score is POOR (<45):
🚨 **Not primed for movement**
🚨 **Weak technical setup**
🚨 **Low probability of success**

**Action:** Avoid or wait for confirmation

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Appropriate Filters
- **Aggressive traders:** `--min-score 60` (more opportunities)
- **Moderate traders:** `--min-score 70` (balanced approach)
- **Conservative traders:** `--min-score 80` (only best setups)

### 2. Check TA Signals
- Read the specific signals for each play
- Look for multiple confirming indicators
- Pay attention to volume ratios

### 3. Consider Premium Size
- Large premium (>$5M) + High TA = Highest conviction
- Small premium + High TA = Good setup, smaller size
- Large premium + Low TA = Smart money hedging, be cautious

### 4. Monitor Strike Relationship
- Calls 0-5% OTM with high TA = Excellent probability
- Calls >10% OTM even with high TA = Lottery ticket
- ITM calls with high TA = Very high conviction

### 5. Use Multiple Timeframes
- Check daily TA for swing trades
- Use intraday analysis for day trades
- Combine with earnings calendar

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Integrate with Your Trading System
```python
from flow_pdf_parser import FlowPDFParser
from flow_ta_engine import FlowTechnicalAnalyzer

# Parse flow
parser = FlowPDFParser("flow.pdf")
data = parser.parse()

# Analyze specific ticker
analyzer = FlowTechnicalAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_ticker("AAPL", "calls_bought", 180, 2_500_000)

# Use TA score in your system
if result['ta_score'] >= 75 and result['technical_indicators']['rsi'] < 40:
    # Execute trade with high conviction
    execute_trade(ticker, strategy="oversold_bounce")
```

### Customize Scoring Weights
Edit `flow_ta_engine.py` line 63-68 to adjust component weights:
```python
analysis['ta_score'] = (
    technical_score * 0.30 +    # Increase technical weight
    volume_score * 0.20 +       # Increase volume weight
    level2_score * 0.15 +       # Reduce L2 weight
    momentum_score * 0.20 +
    strike_score * 0.10 +
    flow_score * 0.05           # Reduce flow weight
)
```

## 📱 Integration Commands

### One-Command Workflow
```bash
# Morning routine: Check flow + TA
python flow_enhanced.py "latest_flow.pdf" --send --min-score 70 --channel alerts
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Analyze multiple PDFs
for file in Downloads/Flow*.pdf; do
    python flow_enhanced.py "$file" --send --min-score 75
done
```

### Scheduled Analysis
```bash
# Cron job (Linux/Mac): Every day at 9:35 AM
35 9 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/quant-alphavantage && python flow_enhanced.py "$(ls -t ~/Downloads/Flow*.pdf | head -1)" --send --min-score 70
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### TA Scores Seem Low
- **Cause:** Market may be in choppy/range-bound conditions
- **Solution:** Lower `--min-score` threshold or wait for better setups

### Level 2 Data Not Available
- **Cause:** Polygon API key not set
- **Solution:** Set `POLYGON_API_KEY` env variable or proceed without (50/100 default)

### Slow Analysis
- **Cause:** AlphaVantage API rate limits (5 calls/min free tier)
- **Solution:** Upgrade to premium key or reduce number of tickers analyzed

### TA Analysis Fails for Ticker
- **Cause:** Ticker data not available from AlphaVantage
- **Solution:** System will skip ticker and continue with others
