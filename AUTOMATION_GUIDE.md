## Troubleshooting

### Monitor Not Starting?
**Check**: Is market open (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday)?
**Solution**: System waits automatically - just let it run

### Discord Alerts Not Sending?
**Check**: Internet connection and Discord webhook
**Solution**: System retries 3 times automatically with backoff

### API Errors?
**Check**: Polygon API key valid and has quota
**Solution**: System uses 20s timeout and automatic failover to AlphaVantage

### High CPU Usage?
**Normal**: ~5-10% during market hours (15-second cycles)
**After Hours**: <1% CPU (1-minute check intervals)
