## üéØ ATR-Based Targeting System

### Why ATR?

ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility and provides realistic, achievable targets based on stock's actual movement.

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Scales with volatility (more volatile = wider targets)
- ‚úÖ Avoids arbitrary round numbers
- ‚úÖ Realistic based on stock behavior
- ‚úÖ Adapts to market conditions

### Standard ATR Targets

| Target | ATR Multiplier | Typical R:R | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| T1 | 1.5√ó ATR | 1.5:1 | Quick profits, scale out 33% |
| T2 | 2.5√ó ATR | 2.5:1 | Primary target, scale out 33% |
| T3 | 4.0√ó ATR | 4.0:1 | Runner position, final 34% |
| Stop | 1.0√ó ATR | - | Max loss limit |

### Example Calculation

**Stock:** BABA
**Current Price:** $169.50
**ATR (14-day):** $4.20
**Entry:** $167.50

**Targets:**
- T1: $167.50 + (1.5 √ó $4.20) = $173.80
- T2: $167.50 + (2.5 √ó $4.20) = $178.00
- T3: $167.50 + (4.0 √ó $4.20) = $184.30
- Stop: $167.50 - (1.0 √ó $4.20) = $163.30

**Why these work:**
- BABA moves $4.20/day on average
- T1 is 1.5 days of movement (very achievable)
- T2 is 2.5 days of movement (normal swing)
- T3 is 4 days of movement (strong trend)

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Combine with TA Engine

**Old way (basic flow):**
```bash
python flow.py "flow.pdf" --send
```

**New way (agents + TA):**
```
1. @flow-chart-reader [extract PDF data]
2. Run: python flow_enhanced.py "flow.pdf" --min-score 70
3. @flow-entry-analyzer [top TA-filtered plays from step 2]
4. @flow-risk-manager [calculate sizing]
```

### Agent + Python Hybrid

**Agents for:** Analysis, planning, entry calculation
**Python for:** Batch processing, Discord posting, automation

```bash
# Get agent analysis first
# Then format for Discord
python send_discord_multi.py "Entry Analysis" "[paste agent output]" alerts
```

---

## üìã Complete Workflow Example

### Morning Flow Routine

**9:30 AM - Flow PDF arrives**

```
@flow-chart-reader
Extract all data from today's flow report
[attach flow PDF]
```

**9:35 AM - Identify best setups**

Run TA filter:
```bash
python flow_enhanced.py "flow.pdf" --min-score 75
```

**9:40 AM - Get entries for top plays**

```
@flow-entry-analyzer
Provide entry analysis for these high TA score plays:
1. BABA $220C (TA: 78)
2. CRWV $150C (TA: 82)
3. SMCI $55C (TA: 76)
```

**9:45 AM - Risk management**

```
@flow-risk-manager
Account: $100,000
Current heat: 8.5%

Check these three positions:
[paste entry analysis]
```

**9:50 AM - Execute approved trades**

Set alerts at entry zones from agent analysis

**Result:** Complete institutional-grade analysis in 20 minutes

## üö® Important Notes

### Agent Limitations

**Flow Chart Reader:**
- Requires clear, readable PDFs/images
- May struggle with handwritten notes
- Best with standard flow report formats

**Flow Entry Analyzer:**
- Needs AlphaVantage API for ATR/price data
- ATR targets assume normal market conditions
- Entry zones require discretion based on market structure

**Flow Risk Manager:**
- Assumes standard option pricing (100 shares/contract)
- Greeks are estimates without actual option chain data
- Portfolio heat requires you to track existing positions

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify agent output** - Especially price data
2. **Use discretion on entries** - Agents provide zones, you pick exact entry
3. **Monitor correlations** - Agent warns, but you track all positions
4. **Adjust for catalysts** - Agent doesn't know about surprise earnings
5. **Scale position sizes** - Use partial positions if uncertain

## üîß Advanced Customization

### Modify ATR Multipliers

Edit `flow-entry-analyzer.md` to change target multipliers:

```
Default:
T1 (1.5 ATR) | T2 (2.5 ATR) | T3 (4.0 ATR)

Aggressive:
T1 (1.0 ATR) | T2 (2.0 ATR) | T3 (3.0 ATR)

Conservative:
T1 (2.0 ATR) | T2 (3.5 ATR) | T3 (5.0 ATR)
```

### Adjust Risk Limits

Edit `flow-risk-manager.md` to change defaults:

```
Default: 1-2% risk per trade, 15% portfolio heat

Aggressive: 2-3% risk, 20% heat

Conservative: 0.5-1% risk, 10% heat
```
